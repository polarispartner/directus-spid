# üì¶ How to Build and Push the Docker Image to Azure ECR

After making changes, you can build and push a new Docker image following these steps:

1. **Login to Azure**:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG .
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker build -t directus-spid:11.6.1-spid13 .
   ```

3. **Tag the Docker image for the Azure Container Registry**:

   ```bash
   docker tag $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG $LOGIN_SERVER/$IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker tag directus-spid:11.6.1-spid13 ifodevregistry.azurecr.io/directus-spid:11.6.1-spid13
   ```

4. **Push the Docker image to Azure ECR**:

   ```bash
   docker push ifodevregistry.azurecr.io/directus-spid:11.6.1-spid13
   ```

5. **If the push fails**, login to the Azure ECR with Docker:

   ```bash
   docker login $LOGIN_SERVER \
     --username <clientId> \
     --password <clientSecret>
   ```

   You can find the username and password in the Azure portal under:  
   **Settings ‚Üí Identity** for your Azure Container Registry.

## üìÑ Understanding Our License

Directus is licensed under [the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1](./license) with a permissive additional use grant.
For most users, it operates just like open source! Here's what that means for you:

### Free for Most Users

If your organization has less than $5M in annual revenue and/or funding combined, you can use Directus freely in any way
you'd like. Build that side project, launch your startup, or experiment with the platform ‚Äî no strings attached.

### Enterprise Usage

For larger organizations (>$5M in annual revenue/funding) using Directus in production, we require a commercial license.
This model helps us maintain a sustainable balance: keeping Directus free for the majority of our community while
ensuring larger organizations who benefit from the platform contribute to its continued development.

### Why This Approach?

We believe in making powerful data tools accessible to everyone. This license lets us:

- Keep Directus free for individuals, startups, and smaller companies
- Maintain active development and strong support
- Continue improving the platform for everyone
- Stay sustainable as an independent project
